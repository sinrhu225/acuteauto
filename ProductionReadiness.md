AcuteAuto Production Readiness

This page will list out all the items to make AcuteAuto Production Ready.

  * Need a backup database, to hold the data for the demo website, because the customers can mess up the data on the demo.
  * Need a batch job to overwrite the demo database with the backup database on a _daily/hourly_ basis.
  * Manual Testing of each and every functionality.
  * PVS Testing once manual testing passed.
  * Steps/Scripts to add/delete a new client(use acuteauto.info for that).
